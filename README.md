# Energy Breakthrough

A collection of projects related to the [Energy Breakthrough](https://www.eb.org.au) vehicle our local primary school races.

The school runs 2 "Human Powered Vehicles" (pedal-powered reverse/tadpole trikes) that are based on an off-the-shelf kit frame and hand-made corflute/ziptie/tape shells.

Our (Ballarat Hackerspace) goals are basically to help improve the vehicles through a bunch of small individual projects that improve the quality-of-life of the kids using the vehicles, from better internal air ducting to safer exit-in-a-crash systems.

## Brainstormed Ideas

- 3D printed headlight that gives better light than the current LED torch, while also having a clear cover to improve airflow around the nose.
- Better intake/air-ducting/exit system for sending fresh air towards the rider on hot days. Currently has a bunch of big holes drilled front and back, which still gives very little airflow but also causes lots of drag.
- Better clips/fixtures for the hinged canopy that allow both the rider and people outside the vehicle to quickly open the canopy in the case of a crash. Currently has elastic hoops over hooks only on the inside, with no external access other than ripping it open.
- Remove the corflute interior wheel covers which interfere with the riders hands when at full lock, and replace with wheel-hugging 3D printed covers that take up less space.
- 3D printed covers for the axel bolt access holes.
